We adopt pre-trained [ResNet-18](https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-5c106cde.pth) and [Swin-B-224](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/storage/releases/download/v1.0.0/swin_base_patch4_window7_224_22k.pth) as backbone networks.  
Download both pre-trained models and move them to this folder.
Rename downloaded ResNet-18 model file to *resnet18.pth*.
Rename downloaded Swin-B-224 model file to *swin224.pth*.
